# Exploring Gender Equality in the EU

## Purpose

Show a workflow in creating an interactive dashboard and some data munging tips.

Focus is on:

- Getting data from excel into R with some nice functions etc.
- Interactive charts
- Data viz

## Intro

Data from [landing page](https://eige.europa.eu/gender-equality-index/2021) and you can download the excel sheet [here](https://eige.europa.eu/sites/all/modules/custom/eige_gei/app/content/downloads/gender-equality-index-2013-2015-2017-2019-2020-2021.xlsx).

There are more than 140 indicators that fall into 6 domains and 14 sub-domains.

## Description of data ingestion challenge

The data comes in a common format -- there is an excel workbook with a readme sheet, then a metadata sheet describing the different variables, then a sheet for the years 2010, 2012, 2015, 2017, 2018 and 2019.

We can make a simple plot of the index changes over time, in relative terms and in absolute terms.

## Ingest

### Readme sheet

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
theme_set(theme_light())
df <- readxl::read_excel(here("data/Gender-equality-index.xlsx"))

df %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

### Codebook

The problem is that this is written in a silly way - it's readable to humans but not to computers

```{r}
# df <- readxl::read_excel(here("data/Gender-equality-index.xlsx"), sheet = 2, range = )
```


### Data read in process

What we want to do is take the wide dataset from the year tabs and then make them long so that we can collect them together and draw some functions over time.

I should make a graphic of how we go from colours having meaning to columns containing this kind of information. Like a panel on the left where we have a screenshot of the excel sheet - then an arrow - then on the right we have a nice simple grouped dataset on the right.

```{r}
sheets <- tibble(sheet = 3:8,
       year = c(2010, 2012, 2015, 2017, 2018, 2019))

get_data <- function(sh){
  
  message("Getting data from ", sh)
  
  df <- readxl::read_excel(here("data/Gender-equality-index.xlsx"), sheet = sh)
  
  df <- df %>% 
    janitor::clean_names() %>% 
    pivot_longer(-c(index_year:gender_equality_index))
  
  df
  
}

sheets <- sheets %>% 
  mutate(data = map(sheet, possibly(get_data, "failed")))

df <- sheets %>% 
  unnest(data)
```

### Data augmentation

We might want to get the English names of a country

```{r}
df %>% 
  count(country)
```

We can use the `countrycode` package:

```{r}
library(countrycode)

countries <- df %>% 
  distinct(country)

countries <- countries %>% 
  mutate(country_name = countrycode(country, "iso2c", "country.name")) %>% 
  mutate(country_name = case_when(
    country == "EU" ~ "European Union",
    country == "EL" ~ "Greece",
    TRUE ~ country_name
    
    
  ))

df <- df %>% 
  inner_join(countries)
```


```{r}
df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(index_year, gender_equality_index, colour = country_name)) +
  geom_line()

```

How can we make the countries more clear?

`gghighlight`

```{r}
countries_highlight <- df %>% 
  distinct(country_name) %>% 
  sample_n(6) %>% 
  pull()

df %>%
  mutate(flag = case_when(
    country_name %in% countries_highlight ~ 1,
    TRUE ~ 0
  )) %>%
  ggplot(aes(index_year, gender_equality_index, colour = country_name)) +
  geom_line() +
  gghighlight::gghighlight(flag == 1) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::number_format(accuracy = 1, big.mark = "")) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(scale = 1))

```


Recreate a nice ranking change?

```{r}

```

## Shiny app

recreate the economists interactive chart 

```{r}
knitr::include_url("https://archive.ph/JJiJU")
```

What are the components??

- Dropdown in which you select the country

What are the charts that are shown?

Maybe use modules in shiny here?

Charts show 

- Higher education gap
- Labour foce participation rate
- Gender wage gap
- Net child-care costs
- Paid leave for mothers
- Paid leave for fathers
- GMAT exams taken by women as a percentage of the total
- Women in managerial positions
- Women on company boards
- Women in parliament
