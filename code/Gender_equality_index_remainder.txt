## Shiny app

recreate the economists interactive chart 

```{r}
knitr::include_url("https://archive.ph/JJiJU")
```

What are the components??

- Dropdown in which you select the country

What are the charts that are shown?

Maybe use modules in shiny here?

Charts show 

- Higher education gap
- Labour force participation rate
- Gender wage gap
- Net child-care costs
- Paid leave for mothers
- Paid leave for fathers
- GMAT exams taken by women as a percentage of the total
- Women in managerial positions
- Women on company boards
- Women in parliament

What do we have in the dataset?

```{r}
df %>% 
  count(name) %>% view

df %>%
  filter(name == "segregation") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(year, value, colour = country_name)) +
  geom_line()

df %>%
  filter(name %in% c("self_perceived_health_good_or_very_good_percent_w",
                     "self_perceived_health_good_or_very_good_percent_m",
                     "self_perceived_health_good_or_very_good_percent_t",
                     "self_perceived_health_good_or_very_good_percent")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(year, value, colour = name)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~ country_name)

# self_perceived_health_good_or_very_good_percent_w

```

We want to create a ratio for the stats that exist for men and women.

#### Higher ed gap

```{r}
df %>% 
  filter(str_detect(name, "graduates_of_tertiary_education_percent")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(year, value, colour = country_name)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~ name)
```
